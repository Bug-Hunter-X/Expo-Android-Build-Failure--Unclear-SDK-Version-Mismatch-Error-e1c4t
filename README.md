This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive bug encountered when building Android apps with Expo CLI. The problem stems from an inconsistency between the specified and installed Android SDK versions, leading to cryptic error messages during the build process. This example illustrates the issue and provides a solution to resolve the SDK version conflict. The `expoBug.js` file showcases a project setup that triggers the error, while `expoBugSolution.js` offers a solution involving explicit version management and synchronization.
