To resolve the SDK version mismatch, ensure that the Android SDK version specified in your project's `android/gradle.properties` file accurately reflects the version installed on your system.  You might need to use the Android SDK Manager to install or update the necessary components.  Then, clean your project and attempt the build again.  Below is an example of how you might update your `gradle.properties` file to match your installed SDK: 
```gradle
android.compileSdkVersion=33
android.minSdkVersion=21
android.targetSdkVersion=33
```
Make sure these values align with your SDK installation. If you are unsure of your installed SDK version, check the Android SDK Manager or use the Android Studio SDK Manager to identify the correct numbers.  After making these changes, run `expo prebuild` and then `expo build:android` again.
