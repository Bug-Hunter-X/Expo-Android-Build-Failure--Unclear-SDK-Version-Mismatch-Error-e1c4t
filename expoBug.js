This error occurs when using Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves a mismatch between the Android SDK version specified in your project and the version actually installed on your system.  The error message might not explicitly state the version mismatch but instead hint at issues during the build process, such as compilation failures related to Android libraries. This can happen if you recently updated your Android SDK or if there's a discrepancy between what's defined in your `android/gradle.properties` file and your environment.
